To create a mod for PowerBox, all you have to do is put a folder in the mods folder. Witching said folder, put text files representing each element in the mod. In the text file, put words corresponding to the settings of the element. Here is an example element. The numbers at the start represent the line numbers.
1) Awesomeness (the name of the element)
2) #000000 (the hex value of the colour of your element. Leave blank for an invisible element.)
3) Solid (the state of the element, Solid, Liquid, Gas, Fire or Block (block is solid that's not affected by gravity))
4) Nothing (what the element does when fire hit it. Chose from explode, ignite nothing or burn. (Burn is like ignite, except ignite just burns, while burn lights it on fire and then gradually disappears. Ignite is for infinite burning, burn is for normal)
5) 50g (its weight per pixel. Look at other elements to see what yours should be.)
6) Stone (It's specific reactions. Format is element it comes into contact with on line 6, element it turns into on line 7, the element the other element turns into on line 8)
7) Water
8) Water
You can keep doing specific reactions 3 lines at a time until you want to stop.
